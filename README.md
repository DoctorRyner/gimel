## How to run the examples?

Just enter the examples folder and type `make`

## Tools

We use:
* `PureScript` as a programming language because it's much more powerful and less error-prone than `JavaScript`, install it using `npm i -g purscript`
* `spago` as a PureScript build tool, it's much more flexible and reliable than pulp, install it using `npm i -g spago`
* `parcel` as a web bundler, we use it because it doesn't require ANY configuration in opposite to `webpack`
* `sae` as a scripting tool that is similar to Makefile, you can install it from https://github.com/DoctorRyner/sae

## Templates

You can grab one of these for your project that will help you to start fast and without any pain

For any template you need:
1. To fetch JS dependencies by typing `npm i`
2. To enter the development mode typing `sae`

### EMPTY

Doesn't contain anything and just logs `Hello, world!` in the browser console

This template is good for your own code structuring

### BASE

Contains basic project structure to develop in a standard way

### Quick Start

Contains some basic examples to play around with (we also show how to use react widgets like material-ui)
